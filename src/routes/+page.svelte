			I'm a Physics PhD student currently living in Poland. My research is
			focused on the static and dynamic study of micromagnetic systems
			such as coupled skyrmions, spin wave generations, antidot lattices.
			To achieve it, I develop my own post processing and simulation
			software as well as using MuMax3. I mostly use Python, Rust, and Go.

		</h2>
		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			I grew up in Brittany, France, where I studied Physics at the
			University of Rennes 1. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics
			in 2018. I then moved to pursue a Double Diploma Master's degree,
			Master of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in at the University of
			Rennes 1 and Physics of Advances Materials for Energy Processing at
			the Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. I am
			currently a PhD student at AMU working on my thesis "Numerical
			Simulations of Collective Spin-Wave Dynamics in Complex Magnetic
			Textures in Patterned Ferromagnetic Films". During my phd, I worked
			on national and european projects, I am the PI of a NCN PRELUDIUM
			grant "Designing an experimentally feasible two-dimensional magnonic
			crystal for the demonstration of topologically protected spin
			waves.". I was the first foreigner to receive the AMU fundation
			scholarship in 2025.

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			I attended 18 international conferences and workshops throughout
			Europe and the Americas and helped organize 5 conferences. I have
			published 10 papers in peer-reviewed journals. I co-supervised 5
			Master's students and I have also taught micromagnetic simulation
			classes for 2 years. I did two research internships, one at the
			University of Vienna in Austria and the other at the University of
			Porto in Portugal. I recieved 9 ‚ÄúInicjatywa Doskona≈Ço≈õci - Uczelnia
			Badawcza‚Äù grants.
