			I'm a Physics PhD student currently living in Poland. My research is
			focused on the static and dynamic study of micromagnetic systems
			such as coupled skyrmions, spin wave generations, antidot lattices.
			To achieve it, I develop my own post processing and simulation
			software as well as using MuMax3. I mostly use Python, Rust, and Go.

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			I grew up in Brittany, France, where I discovered my passion for
			physics. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Physics at the
			University of Rennes 1 in 2018. From there, I pursued a Double
			Diploma Master’s, studying Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at Rennes
			1 while also completing the Physics of Advanced Materials for Energy
			Processing program at Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) in Poznań,
			Poland. I’m now a PhD student at AMU, researching “Numerical
			Simulations of Collective Spin-Wave Dynamics in Complex Magnetic
			Textures in Patterned Ferromagnetic Films.” During my PhD, I’ve
			worked on both national and European projects and currently serve as
			PI for an NCN PRELUDIUM grant titled “Designing an experimentally
			feasible two-dimensional magnonic crystal for the demonstration of
			topologically protected spin waves.” In 2025, I became the first
			foreigner to receive the AMU Foundation scholarship. I have won the
			Intermag Sensor Challenge in 2022 and got 2nd place in the 2024
			edition. Me and my team placed 3rd in the European Defense Tech Hub
			hackathon in Warsaw.

			Throughout my doctoral studies, I have attended

			<a href="/conferences" class="text-blue-500">
				17 international conferences</a
			>
			and workshops across Europe and the Americas, and helped organize 5 events.
			I have published
			<a href="/publications" class="text-blue-500"> 10 papers</a> in
			peer-reviewed journals, co-supervised 5 Master’s students, and
			taught micromagnetic simulation classes for 2 years. Additionally, I
			completed research internships at the University of Vienna in
			Austria and the University of Porto in Portugal. Along the way, I’ve
			received 9 grants through the Inicjatywa Doskonałości – Uczelnia
			Badawcza program. I like to tinker and build things, check out
